Graceful degradation refers to the strategy of building web applications to provide a basic level of user functionality in older browsers whilst still delivering a "fuller" experience in modern environments. This  ensures that even if some advanced features are unsupported, the core functionalities of the web application remain operational in old browsers. Service workers are scripts that run in the background that provide features like offline support, background sync, and intercepting network requests. By caching important assets, when the user is offline, service workers can significantly degrade the user experience gracefully.
